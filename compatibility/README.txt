Most scripts in Robochameleon were developed for Matlab R2014a. However,
sometimes it's necessary to run the code on previous versions. This fol-
der is for functions included in R2014 but not earlier releases. If in-
cluded in the path, it will overwrite Matlab's native and presumably
faster functions, so this should only be done when absolutely necessary.

In the compatibility folders there are now multiple subfolders which names 
are the versions of matlab that introduced those functions.

Example: folder 8.1 hosts compatibility functions not present before MATLAB 8.1

In this way we can selectively add only part of the compatibility layers.
